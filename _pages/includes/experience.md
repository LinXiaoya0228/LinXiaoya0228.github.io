# 💼 Research & Work Experience

### **[GlobalFoundries](https://gf.com/) - Data Scientist Intern**   
*May 2025 – Dec 2025 | Singapore*  
**Research Focus: Intelligent Data Engineering for Scalable Analysis and Visual ML**

**Project 1: Scalable Trace Data Pipeline & Compression for Semiconductor Analytics**  
- Designed and deployed a modular pipeline using **AWS S3**, **PySpark**, **Parquet** and **Snappy** to process multi-month trace data across tools.  
- Enabled **multi-tool, multi-month analysis** with schema alignment and long-to-wide transformation, reducing extraction time from **hours to 4–8 minutes**. 
- Achieved **90% storage reduction**, eliminated memory crashes, and unlocked parameter-level filtering for engineers.

**Project 2: Hybrid Fault Detection via Trace-to-Image Machine Learning Model**  
- Developed a **two-stage Guard-band + OC-SVM architecture** for unsupervised fault detection in semiconductor manufacturing. 
- Converted time-series traces into **Gramian Angular Field (GAF)** images for ML-based classification.
- Addressed training contamination and subtle anomaly detection through statistical filtering and image-based encoding. 
- Achieved **95.05% accuracy, 0.89 recall,** and **1.00 precision (0 False Alarm)**, outperforming traditional guard-band SPC methods by **14%**.




### **[A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) - Healthcare Data Pre-Processing Research Intern**  
*Jan 2025 – Apr 2025 | Singapore*  
- Co-led a team of 5 interns in a collaborative project with **National Healthcare Group (NHG)** to anonymize facial healthcare datasets for AI validation. 
- Applied **rPPG-based feature preservation** to optimize preprocessing for downstream model performance. 
- Delivered insights to clinical and technical stakeholders through structured reporting and presentations. 

### **[Classbro (Shanghai DAOBI EdTech)](https://www.classbro.com/) - Data Science & ML Instructor**  
*Jun 2024 – Dec 2024 | Hybrid*  
- Developed and delivered bilingual lectures on core ML algorithms and SQL  
- Designed course content that contributed **SGD 10,000+ revenue growth**
