  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td style="border: none; width: 60%; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 20px;">
      <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Processing multi-month sensor traces caused memory crashes and took hours.<br>
      [cite_start]<strong>The Solution:</strong> Built a scalable ETL pipeline using <code>AWS SageMaker</code>, <code>PySpark</code>, and <code>Snappy</code> compression[cite: 38].</p>
      <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>📉 <strong>90%</strong> Reduction in storage file size[cite: 38].</li>
