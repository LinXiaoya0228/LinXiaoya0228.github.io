      <h3>1. Scalable Trace Data ETL Pipeline</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> Processing multi-month sensor traces caused memory crashes and took hours.<br>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> Built a scalable ETL pipeline using <code>AWS SageMaker</code>, <code>PySpark</code>, and <code>Snappy</code> compression.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>📉 <strong>90%</strong> Reduction in storage file size.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>97%</strong> Faster data extraction time.</li>
        <li>🛠 <strong>Tech:</strong> <code>PySpark</code>, <code>AWS S3/Boto3</code>, <code>Parquet + Snappy</code>, <code>ETL Optimization</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Trace-to-Image Fault Detection (GAF-CNN)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> Existing methods were not suitable for classifying unlabeled equipment parameter traces.<br>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> Engineered a novel ensembled method of <strong>Guard-Band + OC-SVM</strong> using Gramian Angular Fields (GAF).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🎯 <strong>95%</strong> Accuracy (Outperforming Guard-Band by 14%).</li>
        <li>🛡 <strong>Valid</strong> for unlabeled anomalies (Zero False Alarms).</li>
        <li>🛠 <strong>Tech:</strong> <code>Python (PyTorch)</code>, <code>Gramian Angular Fields (GAF)</code>, <code>CNN</code>, <code>One-Class SVM</code>.</li>
